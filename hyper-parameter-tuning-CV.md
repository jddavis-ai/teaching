# Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation with TensorFlow: Fine-Tuning Neural Networks for CIFAR-100

## Introduction

In this Jupyter Notebook, we will walk through the process of hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for training a neural network model on the CIFAR-100 dataset using TensorFlow. We will also discuss the use of dropout for regularization and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Step 1: Importing Libraries

We'll start by importing the necessary libraries.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

## Step 2: Loading and Preprocessing Data

### Loading the CIFAR-100 dataset

```python
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.cifar100.load_data(label_mode='coarse')
```

### Preprocessing the Data

```python
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0
```

## Step 3: Splitting Data

We will split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

```python
x_train, x_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(x_train, y_train, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

## Step 4: Creating the Neural Network Model

Let's define a function to create the neural network model. The model includes dropout for regularization and L2 regularization for weight decay.

```python
def create_model(reg_strength, learning_rate):
    # Model architecture
    # ...
```

## Step 5: Hyperparameter Tuning with Cross-Validation

We will perform hyperparameter tuning by iterating through different learning rates and L2 regularization strengths. Early stopping will be used to prevent overfitting.

```python
learning_rates = [0.01, 0.001]
reg_strengths = [0.001, 0.01]
best_model = None
best_val_acc = 0.0

for learning_rate in learning_rates:
    for reg_strength in reg_strengths:
        model = create_model(reg_strength, learning_rate)
        # Early stopping setup
        # Model training
        # Validation accuracy tracking
```

## Step 6: Evaluate the Best Model

We will evaluate the best model found during hyperparameter tuning on the test data and print the test accuracy.

```python
test_loss, test_acc = best_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc * 100:.2f}%')
```

## Conclusion

In this notebook, we've learned how to fine-tune a neural network for the CIFAR-100 dataset using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques. We've also explored the use of dropout and early stopping for better model performance and reduced overfitting.
