# Tips for Improving Your Programming Assignment 3

**Section 1: Initial Assessment and General Suggestions**

1. **Weight and Bias Initialization:**
   - Issue: Weights initialized to a fixed value (1e-2), not optimal.
   - Suggestion: Use Xavier/Glorot or He initialization.
   
   **Code Snippet for Weight Initialization:**
   ```python
   tf.keras.initializers.GlorotUniform()(shape=(prev_dims, curr_dims))
   ```

   - Issue: Biases initialized as zero.
   - Suggestion: Consider using small non-zero values for bias initialization.
   
   **Code Snippet for Bias Initialization:**
   ```python
   tf.Variable(tf.initializers.Constant(0.01)(shape=(curr_dims,)))
   ```

2. **Activation Functions:**
   - Issue: Code uses ReLU activations for hidden layers, a common choice.
   - Suggestion: Verify if ReLU is suitable for your specific problem.
   
   **Code Snippet for ReLU Activation:**
   ```python
   tf.nn.relu(tf.matmul(temp, self.W[i]) + self.b[i])
   ```

3. **Regularization:**
   - Issue: L2 regularization used on weights.
   - Suggestion: Adjust the regularization strength (lambda) using cross-validation.
   
   **Code Snippet for L2 Regularization:**
   ```python
   tf.nn.l2_loss(model.W[i])
   ```

4. **Loss Function:**
   - Issue: Loss function combines softmax cross-entropy and L2 regularization loss.
   - Suggestion: Verify if it's appropriate for your problem.
   
   **Code Snippet for Loss Function:**
   ```python
   tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy) + reg * L2_loss
   ```

5. **Layer Dimensions:**
   - Issue: Ensure correct definition of `layer_dims` to represent input, hidden, and output layer dimensions.
   
   **Code Snippet for Layer Dimensions:**
   ```python
   [input_dim, *hidden_dims, num_classes]
   ```

6. **Variable Naming:**
   - Issue: Correct typos and inconsistencies in variable naming for clarity.
   
   **Code Snippet for Variable Naming:**
   ```python
   self.W.append(tf.Variable(...))
   self.b.append(tf.Variable(...))
   ```

7. **TensorFlow Version:**
   - Issue: Ensure TensorFlow 2.x installed to run this code.

   **Code Snippet for TensorFlow Version Check:**
   ```python
   import tensorflow as tf
   assert tf.__version__.startswith("2.")
   ```

8. **Indexing Error:**
   - Issue: Fix the condition in the loop for weight initialization.
   
   **Code Snippet for Indexing Error Fix:**
   ```python
   # Change 'i == @' to 'i == 0' for the first layer.
   ```

9. **Final Layer Calculation:**
   - Issue: Avoid hardcoding the final layer; make it dynamic for flexibility.
   
   **Code Snippet for Dynamic Final Layer Calculation:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(hidden_dims)):
       # Calculate final layer dynamically
   ```

**Section 2: Additional Tips for Code Review and Improvement**

1. **Code Review Technique:**
   - Suggestion: Consider revising your code before running it to catch bugs and errors.

2. **Additional Performance Considerations:**
   - Suggestion: Low validation accuracy might require hyperparameter tuning, data preprocessing, architecture changes, early stopping, or changing the optimizer.
   
3. **Learning Rate Difference:**
   - Explanation: Understand the difference between learning rates (e.g., 1e-2 vs. 1e-3) and experiment based on your problem.

4. **Biological Neurons and Activation Functions:**
   - Clarification: The sigmoid activation's inspiration from biological neurons.

5. **ReLU Activation and Output:**
   - Explanation: Understand that ReLU's output is unbounded but practically limited.

6. **Cost/Loss Function Impact on Weights:**
   - Clarification: How the cost/loss function indirectly influences weight updates during training.

**Section 3: Summary and Key Tips for Your Programming Assignment**

In this section, we'll summarize the key takeaways and provide you with essential tips to enhance your programming assignment:

**Summary:**

- **Variable Initialization:** Choose proper weight and bias initialization methods for improved convergence. Xavier/Glorot or He initialization is recommended for weights, and consider small non-zero values for biases.

- **Activation Functions:** Ensure that the chosen activation functions, such as ReLU, align with the specific requirements of your problem.

- **Regularization:** Fine-tune the strength of L2 regularization through cross-validation to prevent overfitting.

- **Loss Function:** Confirm that the selected loss function, which combines softmax cross-entropy and L2 regularization loss, suits the nature of your task.

- **Layer Dimensions:** Define `layer_dims` accurately, encompassing input, hidden, and output layer dimensions.

- **Variable Naming:** Maintain consistent and error-free variable naming for better code readability.

- **TensorFlow Version:** Verify that you have TensorFlow 2.x installed if you intend to run the code.

- **Indexing Error:** Correct the indexing error in the weight initialization loop by changing 'i == @' to 'i == 0' for the first layer.

- **Final Layer Calculation:** Avoid hardcoding the final layer and make it dynamic to accommodate changes in the number of hidden layers.

**Key Tips for Your Programming Assignment:**

1. **Prior Code Review:** Review your code carefully before running it to identify and rectify potential bugs and errors.

2. **Performance Considerations:** If you're experiencing low validation accuracy, consider exploring hyperparameter tuning, optimizing data preprocessing, revising your network architecture, implementing early stopping, or experimenting with different optimizers.

3. **Learning Rate Decision:** Understand the significance of learning rates and experiment with different values based on the demands of your specific problem.

4. **Biological Neurons and Activation Functions:** Gain a conceptual understanding of how artificial activation functions, like the sigmoid, are inspired by biological neurons.

5. **ReLU Activation Behavior:** Comprehend that ReLU activation's output is unbounded but practically constrained by numerical limitations.

6. **Loss Function's Role:** Recognize how the cost or loss function guides the weight updates indirectly during training, aiming to minimize the error between predicted and actual values.

These summarized key points and tips will help you address issues and improve the effectiveness of your programming assignment.
